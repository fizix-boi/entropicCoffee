# 2D Lattice

The set of functions contained in latticeFunctions.py are imported from a homework completed duing the Purdue University computational physics class, PHYS 580. While they are a crude and rather poor set of functions, they serve as the building blocks and inspiration for further analysis of populated (non-interacting) random walks.

The containedCoffee notebook is nothing more than just a testing ground for these functions to make sure they still worked after 1.5 years of sitting dormant. The functions will act as the backdrop for generalization into free random walks in higher dimensions.
